    Dynamic Wallpaper Editor
  </title>

  <p>GNOME Shell natively allows the wallpaper to change automatically over
  time, so your wallpaper can be for example a slideshow of your favorite
  pictures, or an image adapting to the daylight.</p>
  <p>A few other desktop environments such as Cinnamon or Mate support this
  format, but some other ones like Budgie are NOT compatible.</p>

    <title>XML dynamic wallpapers</title>
    <p>Dynamic wallpapers are saved as XML files, and this utility helps you
    creating, editing, saving, and applying them.</p>

    <p>With the <gui style="button">Open</gui> button, you can open previously
    saved dynamic wallpaper files (.xml), and <link xref="add_and_order">edit
    them</link>.</p>
    <p>From your file manager, you can also right-click on a dynamic wallpaper
    XML file, click <gui style="menuitem">Open with an other application</gui>,
    and select "Dynamic Wallpaper Editor".</p>

    <p>Save your creation as an XML file with the <gui style="button">Save</gui>
    button, or the <gui style="button">Save asâ€¦</gui> menu item.</p>

    <title>Apply as your wallpaper</title>
    <note style="warning">
      <p>This isn't possible if the app has been installed using Flatpak!</p>
      <p>As a workaround, you may need to use GNOME Tweaks to apply the XML
      file as your wallpaper.</p>
    </note>
    <p>Once your XML file is saved, you can then apply it as your wallpaper
    with the <gui style="button">Apply</gui> menu.</p>
    <p>Adjustment options (zoom, centered, stretched, etc.) are available.</p>
