    Dynamic Wallpaper Editor
  </title>

  <p>GNOME Shell natively allows the wallpaper to change automatically over
  time, so your wallpaper can be for example a slideshow of your favorite
  pictures, or an image adapting to the daylight.</p>
  <p>Dynamic wallpapers are saved as XML files, and this utility helps you
  creating, editing, and applying them.</p>

  <section id="type">
    <title>Select a type of wallpaper</title>
    <p>The three available types are:</p>
    <list>
      <item><p><gui style="button">Slideshow</gui> (all pictures have the same
      duration)</p></item>
      <item><p><gui style="button">Time of the day</gui> (each picture has its
      own duration, and the total is 24 hours)</p></item>
      <item><p><gui style="button">Custom</gui> (each picture has its own
      duration).</p></item>
    </list>
    <p>When you open an empty window to create a new wallpaper, the default
    value is <gui style="button">Custom</gui>.</p>
    <p>When you open an existing XML file, the existing type is detected.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="pictures">
    <title>Add and arrange pictures</title>
    <p>Use the <gui style="button">Add Pictures</gui> button to append images to
    your wallpaper. It's possible to use a picture several times in the same
    slideshow. The <gui style="button">Add a folder</gui> button appends all
    pictures from a directory to the list.</p>
    <p>Then you can arrange them as you want by drag-and-dropping rows, or
   remove them with <gui style="button">Delete</gui> button.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="durations">
    <title>Adjust images duration</title>
    <p>Depending on the chosen type, you can set the duration of each picture
    globally (all pictures will last the same amount of seconds) or
    individually. You can also set the duration of the transition to the next
    image, in seconds.</p>
    <p>If you want to do a wallpaper changing with the daylight, the total
    amount of time should be 24 hours (86400 seconds), transitions included.
    The total duration is displayed in the statusbar, at the bottom of the
    window.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="start-time">
    <title>Set the start time</title>
    <p>If the type is <gui style="menuitem">Daylight</gui>, you should set the
    moment the slideshow begins from the <gui style="button">Start time</gui>
    menu.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="save-apply">
    <title>Save and apply as wallpaper</title>
    <p>Save your creation as an XML file (with the <gui style="button">Save</gui>
    button), and apply it as a wallpaper with the <gui style="button">Set as
    wallpaper</gui> button. Adjustment options (zoom, centered, stretched, etc.)
    are available from the menu next to it.</p>
  </section>
