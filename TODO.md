# Ideas of improvements

## Opening XML files

- Not important: monitor XML files to detect modifications
- Not important: ability to open an XML file by drag-and-dropping it from nautilus

## Adding and managing pictures

- Important: filtering what come from the "add pictures" dialog the same way as for "add a folder"
- Very important: **ensure the memory is freed when deleting a row**
- Important: **remove selectability** from pics' widgets
- Not important: ability to add a picture by drag-and-dropping the file from nautilus
- Not important: search entry, to find a specific file within huge lists

## General

- Important: less ridiculous "automatic fix"
- Not important but cool: experiment things in preview.py and try a "line or grid" setting
- Not important: more clear and useful error messages, including line numbers
- Not important: title widget adapting to the window size

## Translations

<!-- - Important: provide translations to the description in `data/com.github.maoschanz.DynamicWallpaperEditor.appdata.xml.in`, but without cluttering the `.po` file with release notes bullshit XXX update anyway -->
- Not important: Provide translations for the help user manual
